## Abstract
*Background & Aims*
Gluten challenge studies are instrumental in understanding the pathophysiology of celiac disease. Our aims in this study were to reveal early gluten-induced transcriptomic changes in duodenal biopsies and to find tools for clinics.

*Methods*
Duodenal biopsies were collected from 15 celiac disease patients on a strict long-term gluten-free diet (GFD) prior to and post a gluten challenge (PGC) and from 6 healthy control individuals (DC). Biopsy RNA was subjected to genome-wide 3’ RNA-Seq. Sequencing data was used to determine the differences between the three groups and was compared to sequencing data from the public repositories. The biopsies underwent morphometric analyses.

*Results*
In DC vs. GFD group comparisons, 167 differentially expressed genes were identified with 117 genes downregulated and 50 genes upregulated. In PGC vs. GFD group comparisons, 417 differentially expressed genes were identified with 195 genes downregulated and 222 genes upregulated. Celiac disease patients on a GFD were not “healthy”. In particular, genes encoding proteins for transporting small molecules were expressed less. In addition to the activation of immune response genes, a gluten challenge induced hyperactive intestinal wnt-signaling and consequent immature crypt gene expression resulting in less differentiated epithelium. Biopsy gene expression in response to a gluten challenge correlated with the extent of the histological damage. Regression models using only four gene transcripts described 97.2% of the mucosal morphology and 98.0% of the inflammatory changes observed.

*Conclusions*
Our gluten challenge trial design provided an opportunity to study the transition from health to disease. The results show that even on a strict GFD, despite being deemed healthy, patients reveal patterns of ongoing disease. Here, a transcriptomic regression model estimating the extent of gluten-induced duodenal mucosal injury is presented.
